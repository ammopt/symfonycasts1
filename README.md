# Symfony casts - Harmonious Development with Symfony 6

https://symfonycasts.com/screencast/symfony

## Notes

Symfony is packed full of objects that do work, also known as services.
Services are tools.

All work in Symfony is done by a service, even things like routing.

We can use services to help get our work done by autowiring them.

##Useful commands

```
symfony new <project_folder_name>

symfony check:requirements

symfony serve -d

php bin/console debug:autowiring twig

symfony composer require <package>

symfony composer require encore

yarn add bootstrap --dev

yarn add @fontsource/roboto-condensed --dev

symfony composer require symfony/ux-turbo
```
